Loading data
This case study analyzes the dataset of beers and breweries.  The dataset is in a tidy format and values were already cleaned up.

There are 2410 beer entries in the beer dataset which contain the following information
Name: Name of the beer.
Beer ID: Unique identifier of the beer.
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.
Brewery ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.
Style: Style of the beer.
Ounces: Ounces of beer.

The breweries dataset contain the following information about the breweries.
Brew ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.
Name: Name of the brewery.
City: City where the brewery is located.
State: U.S. State where the brewery is located.

The beers and the breweries are linked by Brew id.
    
Raw data is read into df_beer and df_breweries data frame respectively. 
Data is merged on Brew id and merged dataset viz, df_beer, mergebeerclean and saved as csv files under data/processed/ folder. 

Analyzing/Manipulating data

		Answers following question about the dataset
		
1.	Finds missing values in the data set
	Output looks like this :-
	Column		  NA
Brewery_id        0
Brew_name         0
Beer_ID           0
Beer_name         0
ABV              62
IBU            1005
Style             0
Ounces            0
City              0
State             0	

2.	State with the most maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer, state with the most bitter (IBU) beer
	Output :- 
     Brewery_id                 Brew_name Beer_ID                 Beer_name   ABV State
8             2 Against the Grain Brewery    2685            London Balling 0.125    KY
1134        375   Astoria Brewing Company     980 Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA 0.082    OR	
	
3.	Summary statistics for the ABV variable
	Output :- 
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
0.02700 0.05000 0.05700 0.05991 0.06800 0.12500 	
	
4. Plots
	a. Creates a Bar charts for the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state.
	b. Scatter plot for relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content (uses library(ggplot2)
	These plots can be found in report/plots folder
